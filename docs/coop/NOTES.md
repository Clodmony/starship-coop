# Notes

Shared lab notebook. Add findings about the game and the port as you make them, newest at the top of each section,
in the same PR as the work. Each entry: date, issue, then **Observed** (with file:line or a link), **Derived**,
**Guess** and **Unknown** as separate lists. Remove nothing; mark an entry `[wrong, see <date>]` if it turns out
false. Settled knowledge moves into DESIGN.md.

Private notes (your paths, your PC, your logs) go in `local/`, not here.

## Build and run

### 2026-11-04, #1 (WP-01), Windows build

Identity: ROM US 1.0 (SHA-1 `d8b1088520f7c5f81433292a9258c1184afa1457`, `config.yml:34`), commit `ba0781d7`,
Windows 11 Home 10.0.26200, VS 2022 Build Tools, MSVC 19.44.35229.0 (v143), Windows SDK 10.0.26100.0, CMake 4.4.4,
Python 3.13, Git 2.55, generator "Visual Studio 17 2022", Debug, graphics backend DirectX 11 (default).

Observed:

- `git submodule update --init --recursive`, then `python tools/coop/build.py --assets --quiet` builds everything in
  one go: `build: OK (Windows, Debug, 10m22s)` on a fresh build directory. Outputs: `build/x64/Debug/Starship.exe`,
  `build/x64/sf64.o2r`, `build/x64/starship.o2r`, `build/x64/gamecontrollerdb.txt`.
- The ROM from a common dump was in v64 byte order (16-bit swapped, header `37 80 40 12`) despite a `.n64` file name.
  Its SHA-1 matches no entry in `config.yml`. After swapping every byte pair (header `80 37 12 40`) it matches US 1.0.
  `build.py` expects `baserom.z64` in the repo root and does not check the byte order itself (`tools/coop/build.py:120`).
- On Windows the app directory is the working directory: `GetAppDirectoryPath` returns `"."` unless `NON_PORTABLE` is
  set (`libultraship/src/Context.cpp:458-500`). Started with `local/test-a/` as working directory and the two `.o2r`
  files copied there, the game wrote `starship.cfg.json`, `default.sav`, `imgui.ini`, `logs/` and `mods/` into that
  folder and nothing next to the exe. This is how test instances stay apart from the owner's own setup.
- The game booted to the title sequence (window "Starship (DirectX 11)"), checked by a screenshot after 25 s.
- The game log reports `Failed add SDL game controller mappings from "./gamecontrollerdb.txt"` when that file is not in
  the working directory; it is built into `build/x64/`. Copy it into the test folder to get the mappings.
- Torch logs `[error] > Failed to process ast_audio/audio_setup` while building `sf64.o2r`; the build still ends OK.

Unknown:

- Whether the `audio_setup` error affects sound in game (not listened to), and whether upstream builds show it too.
- Release config, Ninja (`--ninja`), Linux and macOS: not tried in this session.

### 2026-11-04, #1 (WP-01), Linux build

Identity: ROM US 1.0 (SHA-1 `d8b1088520f7c5f81433292a9258c1184afa1457`, `config.yml:34`), commit `ba0781d7`, Linux,
GCC, Debug, graphics backend OpenGL (default).

Observed:

- On a fresh worktree of `origin/coop`, `python tools/coop/build.py --assets --quiet` fetched the submodules and built
  everything: `build: OK (Linux, Debug, 2m23s)`. Outputs: `build-cmake/Starship`, `build-cmake/gamecontrollerdb.txt`,
  and `sf64.o2r` and `starship.o2r` in both the repo root and `build-cmake/`.
- The ROM was in v64 byte order (header `37 80 40 12`, `.n64` name) and its SHA-1 matched no entry in `config.yml`.
  `dd conv=swab` gives header `80 37 12 40` and the US 1.0 hash.
- On Linux the `SHIP_HOME` environment variable sets the app directory (`libultraship/src/Context.cpp:481-486`).
  Without it, and with `NON_PORTABLE` off, the directory is `"."` (`libultraship/src/Context.cpp:500`). With
  `SHIP_HOME=<repo>/local/test-boot` and the two `.o2r` files and `gamecontrollerdb.txt` copied there, the game wrote
  `starship.cfg.json`, `default.sav`, `imgui.ini` and `logs/` into that folder and added nothing to
  `$HOME/.local/share` or `$HOME/.config`.
- The game reached the title screen with no input, checked by reading state through gdb and by a screenshot of the
  game window. Sampled about every 7 s: `gGameState` 2 (`GSTATE_TITLE`), `gTitleState` 2, `sCutsceneState` 1, 2, 4, 5,
  then 0 (`TITLE_SCREEN`) at system frame 3090 (`src/overlays/ovl_menu/fox_title.h:20-26`). No crash.
- The attract sequence plays before the title screen unless `gMainController` is -1 or `gGoToTitle` is set
  (`src/overlays/ovl_menu/fox_title.c:204-211`, `src/overlays/ovl_menu/fox_title.c:2156`).
- That run forced `SDL_VIDEODRIVER=x11` so the window could be captured. A plain launch in a Wayland session picked
  the `wayland` driver and also ran (`gGameState` 2, frames advancing).
- Torch logs `[error] > Failed to process ast_audio/audio_setup` on Linux too. `AudioContextFactory::parse` stores the
  audio tables and then returns `std::nullopt` on its normal path
  (`tools/Torch/src/factories/naudio/v1/AudioContext.cpp:44`), and `Companion` logs every empty result as failed
  (`tools/Torch/src/Companion.cpp:319-320`). All three table lines print before the error. The running game has the
  tables: 66 sequences, 33 sound fonts, 4 sample banks.

Derived:

- The `audio_setup` error is a false alarm in Torch's log, not a sign of missing audio data.

Guess:

- Upstream builds log the same error, because the code is in the Torch submodule. Not checked.

Unknown:

- How the sound actually plays: both runs used `SDL_AUDIODRIVER=dummy`, and nobody has listened to it on Linux.
- Release config and macOS: not tried in this session.

## Engine and players

### 2026-11-01, project setup

Observed: see DESIGN.md section 2 (player array, `gCamCount`, object arrays, RNG, event hooks, `USE_NETWORKING`).

Unknown: everything listed in DESIGN.md section 2, "Unknown".

## Determinism

## Networking

## Prior work

### 2026-11-01, triage

Observed:

- No Star Fox 64 entry in the Co-op Anything directory (`data/directory.yaml`, checked 2026-11-01).
- No co-op or online fork found among the Starship forks on GitHub (forks list sorted by stars, checked 2026-11-01).
  Notable forks: `izzy2lost/Starship` (Android), `SgtBilko76/Starship-VR`, `keraion/Starship` (Archipelago).
- Star Fox 64 has a built-in 4-player versus mode; `src/engine/fox_versus.c` holds its logic.

Guess:

- The Archipelago fork (`keraion/Starship`) has client networking code that may be worth reading for how it talks to a
  server from inside the port. Not opened yet.
